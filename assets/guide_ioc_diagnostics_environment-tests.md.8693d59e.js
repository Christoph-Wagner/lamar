While my team at the time and I made some serious improvements in the reliability of the automated deployment, the best thing we did was to add a set of <em>environment tests</em> to the deployment that verified that basic elements of the system were working like:</p><ul><li>Could our code access the configured database?</li><li>Was a certain COM object registered on the server? (I hated COM then and the years haven&#39;t changed my mind)</li><li>Could we connect via remoting to another deployed application?</li></ul><p>The deployments still frequently failed, but we were able to spot <strong>and diagnose</strong> the underlying problems much faster with our new environment tests than we could before by trying to run and debug the not-quite-valid application.</p><p>One of the mechanisms we used for these environment tests was Lamar&#39;s ability to mark methods on configured types as environment tests with the <code>[ValidationMethod]</code> attribute as shown below:</p><p><a id="snippet-sample_validation-method-usage"></a></p><div class="language-cs"><pre><code><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">Database</span> <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token type-list"><span class="token class-name">IDatabase</span></span>
